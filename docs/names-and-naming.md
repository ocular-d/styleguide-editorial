## Directories and filenames

Make file and directory names lowercase.
Separate words with hyphens, not underscores.

Use only standard ASCII alphanumeric characters in file and directory names.

`my_awesomefile.md`

## File types

When you're discussing a file type, use the formal name of the type.

**Do not** use the filename extension to refer generically to the file type.
