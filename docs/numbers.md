Spell out all numbers less than 10.

**:thumbsup: Use**

- *There are three ways to implement this task.*

**:thumbsdown: Don't Use**

- *There are 3 ways to implement this task.*

Try to avoid having a numeral and a noun denoting a number mixed up in one sentence, like:

- *There are 3 ways to implement this task, but we will go over two of them in this help topic.*

If you are adding numbers to a table, use numerals even for numbers 1-9.
Tables are meant to provide fast access to content for analysis.

## Big Numbers

When you are writing big numbers (anything that is larger than a thousand), you can write it either way:

- *1508*
- *1 508*
- *1,508*

There are exceptions though.
When you write years, no separations are required:

-*This feature was released in 2015.*

## Numbers with Nouns

Numbers are often combined with nouns to form complex structures.

- *A 30-day trial*

First, you write the numeral, then comes a hyphen and the first noun - this is how we form an adjective.
And then, you finish up by adding your ‘main’ noun.

More examples:

- *A 2-hour flight*
- *A 10-seat license*
