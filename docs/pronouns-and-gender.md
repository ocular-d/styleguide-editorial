Instead, rewriteâ€”for example, use the second person (you).
Or refer to a person's role (customer, employee, or client).

It's OK to use gendered pronouns (he or she) when you're writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves.

For more guidelines about how to write using gender-neutral pronouns, see [Bias-free](./bias-free.md) communication.
