# Pronouns and gender

::: tip Key Point
:bulb: Don't use gendered pronouns in generic references.
:::

Instead, rewriteâ€”for example, use the second person (you).
Or refer to a person's role (customer, employee, or client).

It's OK to use gendered pronouns (he or she) when you're writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves.
