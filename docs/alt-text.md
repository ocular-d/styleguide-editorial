[Alt text is an essential tool](https://aceseditors.org/news/2020/how-to-write-great-alt-text-and-why-it-matters) that makes your content accessible and comprehensible to readers who have visual impairments.

It ensures that those readers get the same benefit from photos, charts, and other visuals that fully sighted readers get.

## Usability tips

- Include alt text for links and images
- Add an [empty alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/ "Documentation about decorative images on W3C") for decorative images
- Keep alt text to a maximum of 10-15 words
- If an image is so complicated that requires more than a short description to provide value to readers,
consider providing a link to an explanatory text
- Do not editorialize alt text.
It should not include assumptions or interpretations of the image or describe subjectsâ€™ intentions
- Make sure the description of the page's content is accurate to avoid [pogo sticking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pogo-sticking/ "Article about pogo sticking on NNGroup")
- Avoid using "link" as most screen readers already add that word
- [Avoid duplicate links](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/duplicate-links/ "Article about duplicate links on NNGroup") in the same article unless the links are very apart from each other.
   - Unless it's a glossary file
   - Unless it's email addresses (Although an article with duplicate email addresses could be rewritten!)

## Style tips

- Avoid Saxon Genitive "'s" - For example "Acme Corp's website"
- Use consistent terminology when referring to content.
For example, don't mix "Article about $" with "Chapter about $"
- Follow the capitalization of proper names. For example, write "iOS" not "iOs", "venv" not "VENV"
- Use official names. If the website is called, "Acme Help" don't call it "Acme Support Center"
- Use sentence case throughout the text unless the first word is a proper noun that is lower caps
- Don't write "Home Page", just write "website". For example, "Acme website"
