[Alt text is an essential tool](https://aceseditors.org/news/2020/how-to-write-great-alt-text-and-why-it-matters) that makes your content accessible and comprehensible to readers who have visual impairments.

It ensures that those readers get the same benefit from photos, charts, and other visuals that fully sighted readers get.

## Quick List

- It’s important to include alt text whenever an image adds information that is useful to readers of the content.
- Alt text is short, about 10-15 words.
- If an image is complicated and requires more than a short description to provide value to readers, consider providing a link to an explanatory text.
- Alt text should not editorialize; it should not include assumptions or interpretations of the image or describe subjects’ intentions.
