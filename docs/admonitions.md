Admonitions stand out from the main body of text to capture the reader’s attention on something important.
For their nature, they break the reading flow and are perceived as a distraction by readers.
This is why they should be used only when it is necessary.

**Do not overuse admonitions**.<br>
If they appear frequently, the reader will think that they don't contain important information, so they will skip them.

When you use them, keep these recommendations in mind:

- If the admonition is about a specific step, place it inside the step.
- If the admonition is generic about a topic, place it at the beginning of the topic.
- If the admonition is a generic consideration after a series of steps, place it at the end of the topic.
- Never start a section with an admonition.
- Never place two admonitions next to each other.
- Don't nest admonitions.
