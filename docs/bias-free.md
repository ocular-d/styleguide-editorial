**:thumbsdown: Don't use *he, him, his, she, her,* or *hers* in generic references.** Instead:
- Rewrite to use the second person (*you*).
- Rewrite the sentence to have a plural noun and pronoun.
- Use *the* or *a* instead of a pronoun (for example, "the document").
- Refer to a person's role (*reader, employee, customer,* or *client,* for example).
- Use *person* or *individual.*

**When you're writing about a real person, use the pronouns that person prefers,** whether it's *he, she, they,* 
or another pronoun.
It's OK to use gendered pronouns (like *he, she, his,* and *hers*) when you're
writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves.

It's also OK to use gendered pronouns in content such as direct quotations and the titles of works and when gender
is relevant, such as discussions about the challenges that women face in the workplace.

**:thumbsup: Use**

Do you have a daughter?
Here are a few things you can do to inspire and support her interest in STEM subjects.

**In fictitious scenarios, strive for diversity and avoid stereotypes in job roles.**

Choose names that reflect a variety of gender identities and cultural backgrounds.

**In text and images, represent diverse perspectives and circumstances.**

Depict a variety of people from all walks of life participating fully in activities.

Be inclusive of gender identity, race, culture, ability, age,sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class.

Show people in a wide variety of professions, educational settings,
locales, and economic settings. Avoid using examples that reflect primarily a Western or affluent lifestyle.

In drawings or blueprints of buildings, show ramps for wheelchair accessibility.

**Be inclusive of job roles, family structure, and leisure activities.**

If you show various family groupings, consider showing nontraditional and extended families.

**Be mindful when you refer to various parts of the world.**

If you name cities, countries, or regions in examples, make sure they're not politically disputed.
In examples that refer to several regions, use equivalent references—for example, don't mix countries with states or continents.

::: warning Attention
**Don't make generalizations about people, countries, regions, and cultures,** not even positive or neutral generalizations.

**Don't use slang,** especially if it could be considered cultural appropriation, such as *spirit animal.*

**Don't use profane or derogatory terms,** such as *pimp* or *bitch.*

**Avoid culturally sensitive terms,** such as the terms associated with military or political actions or other historic events and eras.

Don't use words that imply pity, such as *stricken with* or *suffering from.*
Don't mention a disability unless it's relevant.
